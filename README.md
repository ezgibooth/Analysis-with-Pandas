# PyCitySchools

In this assignment, Pandas DataFrames are created and manipulated to analyze school and standardized test data.

Background

As the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, a report that includes the following data was created.

## District Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame, including the following:

    - Total number of unique schools

    - Total students

    - Total budget

    - Average math score

    - Average reading score

    - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

    - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

    - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


## School Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:

    - School name

    - School type

    - Total students

    - Total school budget

    - Per student budget

    - Average math score

    - Average reading score

    - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

    - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

    - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

    - Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

    - Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

    - Math Scores by Grade Level

    - Reading Scores by Grade Level

    - Scores by School Spending, School Type and School Size in a dataframe including:

        - Average math score

        - Average reading score

        - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

        - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

        - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
